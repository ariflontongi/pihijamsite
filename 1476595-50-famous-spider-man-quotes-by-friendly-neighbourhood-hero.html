Some of them include Nicholas Hammond, Tom Holland, Tobey Maguire, Neil Patrick Harris and many more others. Here are some of the best Spider-Man quotes from the comics and movies:</p><ul><li>Every day I wake up knowing that the more people I try to save. The more enemies I will make.</li><li>If you keep something as complicated as love stored up inside, it could make you sick.</li><li>You can’t be a friendly neighbourhood spider-man if there is no neighbourhood.</li><li>Whatever happened, happened; it’s like my senses have been dialled to eleven.</li><li>You are much stronger than you think you are. Trust me.</li><li>Anyone can win a fight when the odds are easy! It’s when the going’s tough, when there seems to be no chance – that’s when it counts.</li><li>You can’t think about saving the world. You have to think about saving one person.</li><li>Whatever life holds in store for me, I will never forget these words: 'With great power comes great responsibility.' This is my gift, my curse. Who am I? I'm Spider-Man.</li><li>Every day, I wake up knowing that no matter how many lives I protect, no matter how many people call me a hero, someone even more powerful could change everything.</li><li>No one can win every battle, but no man should fall without a struggle.</li><li>Not everyone is meant to make a difference. But, for me, the choice to lead an ordinary life is no longer an option.</li><li>No matter how buried it gets or lost you feel, you must promise me that you will hold on to hope and keep it alive. We have to be greater than what we suffer. My wish for you is to become hope. People need that.</li><li>Who am I? You sure you want to know? The story of my life is not for the faint of heart. If somebody said it was a happy little tale, if somebody told you I was just your average ordinary guy, not a care in the world, somebody lied.</li><li>But now I think maybe there’s even more to the powers I got that day, and maybe I can use them to help people more than I ever imagined. Tonight, if I hadn’t been open to those powers, I might never have reached that girl in time.</li><li>Everyone has a part of themselves they hide. Even from the people, they love most.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/4081474e8516498e.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>30 amazing Godfather quotes that are still popular to date</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION</strong>: Share your outstanding story with our editors!
