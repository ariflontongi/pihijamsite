The Federal Aviation Administration regulations are quite clear: "No person may operate a civil aircraft in the United States at a true flight Mach number greater than 1" except in certain, very limited conditions.</span></span><h2>Can civilian planes break the sound barrier?</h2>Although Concorde and the Tu-144 were the first aircraft to carry commercial passengers at supersonic speeds, they were not the first or only commercial airliners to break the sound barrier.<h2>Why can't you break the sound barrier?</h2>The compressed air in front of the plane exerts a much larger than usual force on the plane. There is a noticeable increase in the aerodynamic drag on the plane at this point, hence the notion of breaking through the "sound barrier." When a plane exceeds the speed of sound it is said to be supersonic.<h2>Can you break the sound barrier on land?</h2>ThrustSSC is a British-designed and built World Land Speed Record car. ThrustSSC holds the current World Land Speed Record which was set on October 15, 1997, by accomplishing a speed of 763 mph. By doing so, the supersonic car became the first land vehicle to officially break the sound barrier.<h2>Is flying supersonic legal?</h2>Currently, U.S. law prohibits flight in excess of Mach 1 over land unless specifically authorized by the FAA for purposes stated in the regulations. The two supersonic rulemaking activities would not rescind the prohibition of flight in excess of Mach 1 over land.<h2>Can you BREAK THE SOUND BARRIER in a boat? Trailmakers!</h2><p></p><h2>Is sonic boom illegal?</h2>In the 1950s and '60s, Americans filed some 40,000 claims against the Air Force, whose supersonic jets were making a ruckus over land. Then in 1973, the FAA banned overland supersonic commercial flights because of sonic booms—a prohibition that remains in effect today.<h2>Why do we not hear sonic booms anymore?</h2>Why don't we ever hear sonic booms any more? Noise abatement regulations halted supersonic flight (by civil aircraft) over U.S. land. The Concorde could still take off and land here because it broke the sound barrier over the ocean, but it's no longer in service.<h2>Can a pilot hear the sonic boom?</h2>If you're WONDERing about how pilots handle sonic booms, they actually don't hear them. They can see the pressure waves around the plane, but people on board the airplane can't hear the sonic boom. Like the wake of a ship, the boom carpet unrolls behind the airplane.<h2>Does a bullet break the sound barrier?</h2>In fact, bullets can move fast enough to break the sound barrier. Contrary to what the name might suggest, the sound barrier is not an actual wall or barrier. Rather, it is the hypothetical limit to the speed an object can travel before it exceeds the speed of sound.<h2>Has a 747 ever broken the sound barrier?</h2>As it shot across the Atlantic, the Boeing 747-400 jet reached a top ground speed of 825 mph. However, the jet did not actually break the sound barrier, because that is measured by its airspeed, or the speed of the plane relative to the air through which it is traveling.<h2>Does a towel whip break the sound barrier?</h2>We have used high-speed photographic methods to show that the tip of the towel does indeed break the sound barrier. An experiment reported by Bern- stein et al. ' in 1958 showed that the tip of a cracked bull whip exceeds the speed of sound.<h2>Is it possible to break the sound barrier without sonic boom?</h2>NASA has commissioned engineers to design a new kind of jet that can travel faster than the speed of sound, but without the telltale sonic boom. Instead, the aircraft will produce a soft thump as it breaks the sound barrier, which the researchers are adorably calling a "supersonic heartbeat".<h2>Can you feel a sonic boom?</h2>“When they break the sound barrier, a boom can sometimes be heard or felt as shaking on the ground, and our seismometers can record the shaking,” shares Katherine Whidden with UUSS. “Certain atmospheric conditions, such as inversions, can trap the energy and make it more likely to be widely felt on the ground.”<h2>Can Sonic the Hedgehog break the sound barrier?</h2>As his name implies, he reaches sonic speeds, meaning that he can travel as fast as a soundwave through Earth's atmosphere: roughly 767 miles (1,235 kilometers) per hour, depending on air temperature. He also becomes "Super Sonic," so it's safe to assume he exceeds the speed of sound as well. That's incredibly fast!<h2>Can you hear a supersonic plane coming?</h2>Short answer: Yes, pilots of a supersonic jet can still hear the humming of the engines when their plane breaks the sound barrier if the sound is transmitted through the air inside the plane (however, they cannot hear the sounds coming from the outside).<h2>Is it loud inside a fighter jet?</h2>The cockpit of a fighter aircraft will be very noisy and their mean levels range from 95 to 105 dB. This exceeds the damage risk criterion of 8h/day exposure.<h2>Can a BB gun break the sound barrier?</h2>When looking at the matter of sound barrier FPS, you are looking at an airgun capable of achieving anywhere from 1,000 to 1,600 feet per second at the maximum. The sound barrier is usually broken anywhere between 1,060 to 1,200 feet per second, depending on the conditions.<h2>Is Sonic faster than a bullet?</h2>Assuming Sonic is about the weight of a small man, he'll accelerate at about 64 meters per second squared, which generates a force of about 4,480 Newtons. A bullet, in comparison, flies at an average speed of 1,700 miles per hour.<h2>Is a bullet faster than lightning?</h2>That is faster than a bullet fired from an assault rifle- 1000 metres per second.<h2>Why do sonic booms break glass?</h2>When you have a large window, and a sonic boom comes along, a relatively small pressure difference can set up very large tensile forces in the surface of the glass (especially if the shock wave cannot easily "go around the back" of the glass).<h2>Is Thunder a sonic boom?</h2>Keep in mind these shock waves are produced when the intense heat of lightning superheats air, causing it to expand faster than the speed of sound. Thunder is essentially a sonic 'boom'.<h2>Why do jets make clouds when they break the sound barrier?</h2>Because aircraft wings generate both low-pressure regions (because of lift) and amplified low-pressure disturbances, large low-pressure regions exist near the aircraft, especially under sonic flight conditions. The lowered pressure condenses the water in the air, creating a vapor cloud.<h2>Is there a sonic boom at Mach 2?</h2>The speed of sound is the same as the wave speed. The plane makes a sonic boom when it's going faster than sound. There is nothing special happening at Mach 2.<h2>How fast does a jet have to go to break the sound barrier?</h2>The speed at which you break the sound barrier depends on many conditions, including weather and altitude. It's approximately 770 mph or 1,239 kmh at sea level.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye8KapWaxn6p6rbHGmqOlsV2Xv6atymaroZ1dqLy2usNmmZqqop6ysw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcan-you-legally-break-the-sound-barrier.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fcan-you-legally-break-the-sound-barrier.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fcan-you-legally-break-the-sound-barrier.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fcan-you-legally-break-the-sound-barrier.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcan-you-legally-break-the-sound-barrier.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcan-you-legally-break-the-sound-barrier.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./carrie-johnson-stuns-in-snake-print-bikini-during-idyllic-beach-holiday.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./carrie-johnson-stuns-in-snake-print-bikini-during-idyllic-beach-holiday.html>Carrie Johnson stuns in snake-print bikini during idyllic beach holiday</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./bobby-riggs-net-worth-income-salary-html.html>Bobby Riggs Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./bobby-riggs-net-worth-income-salary-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
