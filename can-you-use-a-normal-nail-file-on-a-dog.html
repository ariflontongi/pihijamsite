When you check your dog's nails, also check his paw pads for any cuts or foreign bodies.</span></span><h2>Can I use a human nail file on my dog?</h2>Always be sure to use a nail file designed specifically for dogs. Never use a nail file made for humans on your dog's nails.<h2>Can I use a metal nail file on my dog?</h2>You can purchase a metal nail file at a pet store or pharmacy; you don't need to use one specifically labeled for pets. Coarse emery boards work in a pinch, but they'll wear out quickly, especially if you have a larger breed.<h2>Can I file my dog's nails with an emery board?</h2>Emery boards will work just fine for filing a puppy's nails, although you may go through more than 1 emery board in the process. Use a filing tool made for dogs if you have one available. Many pet stores will carry emery board-type tools created specifically for filing dog nails.<h2>Should I file or cut my dog's nails?</h2>When to trim? A good rule of thumb is to trim your dog's nails once they start touching the ground. Much like human nails, a dog's nails will continue to grow and grow until they curl outward, or worse – inward.<h2>How to Dremel Your Dogs Nails - Do-It-Yourself Dog Grooming</h2><p></p><h2>Can you file nails instead of clipping?</h2>Unless you're shortening very long nails, most professional manicurists prefer using an emery board or file to trim nails without using a cutting tool, as they're much gentler. Also, shaping and finishing your nails makes it less likely to break, split, or snag them on something.<h2>Can I use sandpaper to file my dogs nails?</h2>Most dogs are comfortable dragging their nails across 30-40 grit sandpaper, which files down nails fast.<h2>How can I shorten my dog's nails naturally?</h2><p>Ways to File Those Nails Down Naturally</p><li>Agility practice – those contacts are like sand paper and perfect for filing nails.</li><li>Jogging on hard surface – get your exercise and wear down those nails at the same time.</li><li>Biking on hard surface – If you can't run with your dog, this is a good alternative.</li><h2>Can I cut my dog's nails with regular nail clippers?</h2>Human nail clippers can be used to clip your puppies nails, but it will be much harder to do effectively as they grow up. Your adult dog's nails will likely need to be cut using a specialised tool.<h2>Can I use pliers to cut my dog's nails?</h2>There are a variety of options you can use to trim your dog's nails. While some people might prefer guillotine-style clippers, the spring-loaded scissor-style or plier-style nail clippers are favored by most veterinary professionals. These are especially helpful for dogs with thick, tough nails.<h2>How do you soften a dog's nails before cutting them?</h2>Bathe Your Dog First<p>Bathing your dog before trimming her nails softens the nails so that they are easier to clip and less likely to splinter. The massaging motion of cleaning your pet's fur can relax your dog so that she's more docile for a nail clipping. There are some dogs who get overexcited with baths.</p><h2>How do you shorten overgrown dog nails?</h2>Using your preferred clippers, trim a very small bit of nail at a time. Cut at a slight angle across the tip of the nail, following its natural shape. After each cut, look at the freshly-cut tip of the nail to look for the little black dot that tells you when to stop.<h2>Does walking on pavement file dog's nails?</h2>Some dogs will naturally wear down their nails from frequent walks on concrete sidewalks, but if your dog primarily gets their exercise outside, their nails may need to be trimmed as much as once a week.<h2>What is a dog scratchboard?</h2>WHAT IS A SCRATCH BOARD? A scratch board is like a giant nail file for your dog! It's a flat board with sandpaper glued to it. Once you teach your dog how to use it, several brief sessions a week will keep those front nails filed down.<h2>How often do you clip a dog's nails?</h2>Dogs need their nails clipped on a regular basis, approximately every 3-4 weeks; however, it is common for owners to wait too long in between trimmings which can lead to a number of health issues for the animal.<h2>Does filing nails weaken them?</h2>If you get regular manicures or you typically use nail clippers instead of a file, you may never have learned how to safely file your nails. Filing keeps nails strong and healthy while also giving them your desired shape. It's possible to file incorrectly and actually make your nails weaker and more jagged.<h2>Does filing nails strengthen them?</h2>Filing your nails in a back-and-forth motion like a saw can actually weaken your nails. File in one direction only, and go easy on the sides of the nails since filing too much there can weaken the nail.<h2>How short can I grind my dog's nails?</h2>Knowing when to stop trimming can be hard. If you go too short, you'll end up cutting below the quick (tip 2) and hurting your pet. As a general rule, it's enough to grind away the pointed tip until the nail looks relatively straight.<h2>Can you hurt your dog with a nail grinder?</h2>Grinders are also good for dogs with dark nails, where the quick is difficult to see. However, some dogs aren't comfortable with the noise and sensation of grinding, so you may prefer to use clippers. Nail grinders won't hurt your dog, especially if you grind slowly, and quietly, while your pet is calm.<h2>Do long nails hurt my dog?</h2>Long claws are more prone to chipping, tearing, splitting and breaking, which can be very painful and may require veterinary treatment. As well as being prone to damage, when a dog stands or walks on a long-clawed paw it puts pressure on the wrong parts of the foot, causing pain and discomfort.<h2>Can I give my dog Benadryl to cut her nails?</h2>Give Them Benadryl<p>It's not meant for heavy daily use, but will greatly help ease your dog's nerves when it's time to trim their nails. The Merck Veterinary Manual advises that dogs take 2-4 milligrams of Benadryl per kilogram of their weight. This may mean you break a pill apart into a smaller piece.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye8KapWaxn6p6tr%2FEZphmpp%2BnuqK4jKeYoqRdm7atsYyopWaZXZm8qA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcan-you-use-a-normal-nail-file-on-a-dog.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fcan-you-use-a-normal-nail-file-on-a-dog.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fcan-you-use-a-normal-nail-file-on-a-dog.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fcan-you-use-a-normal-nail-file-on-a-dog.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcan-you-use-a-normal-nail-file-on-a-dog.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcan-you-use-a-normal-nail-file-on-a-dog.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./carrie-fisher-wasnt-allowed-to-wear-this-while-filming-star-wars.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./carrie-fisher-wasnt-allowed-to-wear-this-while-filming-star-wars.html>Carrie Fisher Wasn't Allowed To Wear This While Filming Star Wars</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./1593765-breaking-kano-house-assembly-wipes-emirates-council-law.html>BREAKING: Kano House of Assembly Finally Wipes Out Emirates Council Law</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./1593765-breaking-kano-house-assembly-wipes-emirates-council-law.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
