These beaks are sharp and continue to grow throughout the turtle's life. Moreover, turtles also use their pointed beaks to protect themselves from predators. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on turtleconservationsociety.org.my</a><h2>How does a turtle chew?</h2>The edges (occasionally with serrations) are sharp and allow turtles to cut pieces of flesh from carcasses and quickly kill small prey. The cutting edges are also effective in chopping vegetation into bite-size pieces. Turtles do not chew; those that eat mollusks crush them with a broad, thick sheath inside the mouth. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on britannica.com</a><h2>What do turtles have in their mouth?</h2>Turtles have sharp beaks that they use to cut their food—whether it's meat or plants—into pieces before swallowing it. Some turtle species also have special adaptations in their mouths and throats to help them eat.
