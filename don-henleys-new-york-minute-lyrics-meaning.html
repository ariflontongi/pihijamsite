})();<h3 class=wp-block-heading id=new-york-minute>“New York Minute”</h3><p>But that established, whereas the featured narrative is definitely set in New York City, the thesis message isn’t really about geographic location or anything like that.&nbsp;Rather, the term “New York minute” is actually a colloquialism.&nbsp;What it alludes to&nbsp;is the fast pace at which the city moves, i.e. a “New York minute” poetically being shorter than, say a Texas minute.&nbsp;</p><p>And within the context of this song, what Henley is more specifically alluding to is how fast “everything can change” in life.&nbsp;As such, at the center of the narrative is a guy whose world, including most notably the romantic relationship he is in, seems to have unraveled, much to his chagrin.</p><p>That said, there is a whole lot of ambiguity in the lyrics.&nbsp;For instance, it has been put forth that said character, as depicted, commits suicide at the beginning of the song.&nbsp;Some analysts&nbsp;have also concluded, on sort of the conspiracy theory tip, that this piece actually speaks to the World Trade Center disaster.</p><p>But it isn’t likely Henley’s is referring to suicide since in the third verse he mentions “somebody’s going to jail”, and like you can’t imprison someone for killing himself.&nbsp;Also concerning the 9/11 theory, said event transpired some 15 years after this song was dropped, making it logically impossible that it served as the inspiration of this piece, even though said event was one in which literally ‘everything changed in a New York minute’ within the city itself.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=the-narrator-the-observer-and-advisor>The Narrator, The Observer and Advisor</h3><p>And all lyrics considered, the role the vocalist is playing, even though at times he speaks as the aforementioned character from the first person, is that of an observer/advisor, kinda like – for lack of a better analogy – the Watcher from Marvel Comics.&nbsp;</p><p>He bears witness to the life of the primary subject falling apart.&nbsp;And by the looks of things, one day the pressure became too much for said individual to bear, and he did something drastic, possibly committing a crime or, if we really wanted to go out on a limb, assaulting his ex.</p><p>And as far as the advisory aspect of the story goes, in the third verse the vocalist puts forth that if “<strong>you find somebody to love</strong>“, you should do your best to “<strong>hang on tooth and nail</strong>”, i.e. with all you might.&nbsp;So reading in between the lines, the story theoretically breaks down as so.&nbsp;</p><p>Sometime in the past, the vocalist did something to chase the woman he loves away.&nbsp;Eventually that reality, coupled with the other pressures of life, became too much for him to bear.&nbsp;So he ends up doing something extreme, perhaps even momentarily losing his mind.&nbsp;But in the aftermath he has repented of whatever it was on his part which led to his sweetheart bouncing and is believing – for the sake of his own sanity shall we say – that one day she will return.</p>');var c=function(){cf.showAsyncAd(opts)};if(typeof window.cf !== 'undefined')c();else{cf_async=!0;var r=document.createElement("script"),s=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];r.async=!0;r.src="//srv.tunefindforfans.com/fruits/apricots.js";r.readyState?r.onreadystatechange=function(){if("loaded"==r.readyState||"complete"==r.readyState)r.onreadystatechange=null,c()}:r.onload=c;s.parentNode.insertBefore(r,s)}; })();<h3 class=wp-block-heading id=takeaway>Takeaway</h3><p>And again, the ultimate moral of the story, all highfalutin lingo aside, is that love is not to be taken for granted.&nbsp;Yes, Henley takes a very theatrical and macrocosmic approach to leading us to that idea.&nbsp;But at the end of the day, as illustrated in the bridge, none of us know tomorrow as far as enjoying the company of our loved ones is concerned.&nbsp;</p><p>And yes, all of this does sound very much 9/11-ish, considering that thousands of New Yorkers got up that morning and set off on their daily routines, not knowing they would never see their loved ones, and vice versa, ever again.&nbsp;But again this is a message with a universal, timeless applicability.&nbsp;For “in a New York minute”, i.e. the blink of an eye, we may find ourselves devoid of a person who we cannot function properly without.&nbsp;So not only should we appreciate them, but also, as implied, we shouldn’t do anything to drive them away.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.songmeaningsandfacts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/New-York-Minute-by-Don-Henley-Lyrics.jpg><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=don-henley>Don Henley</h3><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Don Henley</a> is a singer who, all things considered, may be better known as a member of The Eagles, a legendary 1970s’ American band.&nbsp;Upon The Eagles’ initial dissolution in the early 1980s, he embarked on a solo career and did for a while experience major success on his own.&nbsp;For instance, Henley’s 1989 project&nbsp;“The End of the Innocence”&nbsp;has been certified sextuple-platinum in the United States.&nbsp;</p><p>And it is from that album that we get&nbsp;“New York Minute”, which also acted as one of its singles.&nbsp;Moreover, the song and album were released by Geffen Records on 27 June 1989.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=who-wrote-new-york-minute>Who wrote “New York Minute”?</h3><p>The writers of this song, besides Henley, are Jai Winding and Danny Kortchmar.&nbsp;And it is also Henley and Kortchmar who produced&nbsp;“New York Minute”.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=success-of-new-york-minute>Success of “New York Minute”</h3><p>This track proved to be a mild hit, most notably peaking at number five on Billboard’s&nbsp;Adult Contemporary&nbsp;chart. Furthermore, it charted both on the UK Singles and US Hot 100 listings.</p><p>This song appeared on a&nbsp;handful of television shows, including a 1995 (i.e. season 1) episode of&nbsp;Friends.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.songmeaningsandfacts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/New-York-Minute-by-Don-Henley.jpg><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=who-sings-the-backing-vocals-on-new-york-minute>Who sings the backing vocals on “New York Minute”?</h3><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Take 6</a> sings the song’s background vocals.
