<time>13 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><span>While some see her as an artist, others see her as a potential boxing champion.&nbsp;But whatever career Iyanna Mayweather chooses, she has already managed to attract a huge following on social media.&nbsp;It’s all thanks to his expensive and enviable lifestyle, largely funded by his father, American professional boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr.</span></p><p><span>Iyanna is known for splitting her time between working on her music and working out with her dad in the gym.&nbsp;She and her father, who retired with an undefeated record, are said to have a very close bond which has caused fans to call him their favorite child.&nbsp;Read on to learn more about Mayweather’s daughter and her family.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Biography of Iyanna Mayweather (Age)</span></strong></h2><p><span>Iyanna Mayweather was born on May 20, 2000, to Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Melissa Bim.&nbsp;The professional boxer has four children in all and Iyanna is his only child with his mother, who was his girlfriend once.&nbsp;Among his siblings are half-sister Jirah and half-brothers Koraun and Zion, from his father’s relationship with Josie Harris.&nbsp;She has a half-brother, Devion, from her mother’s former relationship.</span></p><p><span>Like all other normal children, Iyanna attended high school, after which she went to a higher institution, but the exact names of the schools she attended are not available.&nbsp;The only way the public got to know a little about her upbringing was when she posted pictures of her graduation on social media.</span></p><p><span>For the public, Iyanna Mayweather has made no significant move towards any career path.&nbsp;This may be the reason for the mixed reviews she received for her song in 2018. In October 2018, a music video titled&nbsp;</span><span>Oh Alright Remix</span><span>&nbsp;was released on YouTube.&nbsp;But a critical analysis of the views revealed that his striking style was central to his concerns.&nbsp;Iyanna has a YouTube channel and tries hard to keep it active.</span></p><p><span>But as the daughter of one of the most talented boxers of all time, she has achieved huge success on social media.&nbsp;With hundreds of thousands of people following her on Instagram and Twitter, Iyanna is nowhere below average in terms of social media presence.&nbsp;As for her popularity, Iyanna caught the public eye with lavish birthday parties sponsored by her father.</span></p><p><span>It doesn’t end there, her dad is known to spoil his daughter by giving her the most expensive things.&nbsp;On her 16th birthday, she invited musical artists such as Drake and Future to perform at her party and also received many gifts.&nbsp;This may seem like the highest of them all, but you will be amazed to know that on her 18th birthday, Iyanna Mayweather was gifted with an 18-carat “Canary PRISTINE” ring worth $5 million.&nbsp;Everything was glitzy at the birthday party celebrated by a host of celebrities.</span></p><p><span>All of these gifts made people wonder if she was her father’s favorite child.&nbsp;Another guess is that the boxer is probably trying to make up for his infamous relationship with Iyanna’s mother.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Who is his mother?</span></strong></h2><p><span>As we mentioned earlier, Iyanna Mayweather is Floyd’s only child with his one time girlfriend, Melissa Brim.&nbsp;Brim is said to have first met the boxer when she was a teenager.&nbsp;By the time they started dating, Melissa already had a son, Devion Cromwell, from a previous relationship, but that was never a problem for Floyd, who even reportedly adopted the child out of love for his mother. .&nbsp;But things quickly soured between them after Melissa got pregnant with Iyanna.&nbsp;According to some sources, they had a falling out at the time and later separated.</span></p><p><span>After Iyanna was born, the pair came back together again, Floyd did his best to catch up with the past.&nbsp;He helped her open a boutique, Devanna Love Boutique, named after her children.&nbsp;In 2012, the once beloved couple broke up again.&nbsp;It was a lousy episode with allegations of physical abuse against Melissa by Mayweather.&nbsp;Floyd got in trouble with the law and was placed under house arrest for a few days.</span></p><h3 class=main-box-title>You may
