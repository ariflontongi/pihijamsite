However, the couple's hectic schedules made it difficult to spend time together and they parted ways in 2019.&nbsp;</p><h2>Serena Williams and Drake</h2><p id=eocOzp5XXc>Tennis queen Serena and Canadian rapper Drake were rumoured to have had an on-and-off relationship from 2011 to 2015.

However, it seems the couple have sparked split rumours with the tennis star removing all traces of Cordae from her Instagram page.&nbsp;</p><h2>Caroline Wozniacki and Rory McIlroy</h2><p id=eYt03mWDXr>This sports couple started dating in 2010 and actually got engaged three years later. In 2014, Rory was said to have called things off in a brief three-minute phone call to Caroline after they sent their wedding invites. Caroline has since married American basketball player David Lee.&nbsp;</p><h2>Andy Roddick and Mandy Moore</h2><p id=etPrR-TVBp>The American star dated actress Mandy Moore in the early 2000s before he married wife Brooklyn Decker. They met on the set of the rom-com How to Deal in 2003. One year after the tennis champion took home the U.S. Open championship title, the former couple called it quits in 2004.&nbsp;</p><h2>Andre Agassi and Brooke Shields</h2><p id=eeVA7PoyCT>The Hollywood star was married to former world number one tennis player Andre Agassi from 1997 until 1999, when they split largely because of his addiction to crystal meth.

"My 16-year-old is more going down the athletics route at the moment," he revealed. "She's doing the 100m and she is quick!"</p><p id=ebaOSmOTK7dk data-wc=42>He added: "I want them to do what they want to do. I don't know if they've got 100% to take what it takes to be footballers, their life has been too nice. My two-year-old son, he's too young at the moment."</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
