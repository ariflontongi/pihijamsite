Although Kimye is no longer together — they finalized their divorce in November 2022 — the exes and&nbsp;co-parents&nbsp;shared some milestone moments over the course of their decade-long relationship.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After meeting through a mutual connection in the early 2000s, the power couple went on to date, marry, and welcome four children. Given their combined fame, their romance garnered constant media attention.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As much as Kardashian pulled at our heartstrings when she&nbsp;posted a video on Twitter&nbsp;of West's grand romantic gesture involving a Kenny G-filled Valentine's Day, it didn't distract from problems, namely West's&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>anti-semitic hate speech</a>&nbsp;and explosive rant on TMZ Live.

I think I had to go through that to figure out what I wanted. After my breakup, I was feeling really low and down, and he said, 'Just come to Paris and see my fashion show,'" Kardashian told Seacrest. "He jokes that he put on this whole fashion show just to get a date with me. So, I went there, and I stayed with him, and that's where we started dating.
