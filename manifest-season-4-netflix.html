<time>20 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>It's official:&nbsp;On <strong>November 4, 2022, </strong>Manifest&nbsp;returned to&nbsp;Netflix for the first installment of its final season. The announcement that the show had been renewed for a fourth season was made at 8.28 a.m. on August 28, 2021—a nod to the pivotal Flight 828 in the series, a plane that returns with its passengers five years after taking off from Jamaica. One year later, on August 28, 2022, the first trailer for season four—which will drop in two batches, with ten episodes apiece—dropped. Almost all of the <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/tv-shows/manifest-season-4-cast/>cast</a>, including leads Josh Dallas and Melissa Roxburgh, returned for the show's final chapter (well, two).</p><p>The August 2021 renewal of&nbsp;Manifest&nbsp;marked a stunning about-face by Netflix, which initially declined to renew the series, as did the show's creator NBC—but both were forced to reconsider after the summer 2021 addition of&nbsp;Manifest&nbsp;seasons one and two to Netflix shattered U.S. streaming records. Later, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/a37037357/manifest-season-3/>season 3 of Manifest</a> was also added to the platform.</p><p>"There is something very meta about the show's death and rebirth, given that that's the story of the series itself," creator Jeff Rake&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://ew.com/tv/manifest-creator-jeff-rake-previews-final-20-episodes/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>said</a>&nbsp;in an interview with&nbsp;Entertainment&nbsp;Weekly.&nbsp;He's referring to the show's titular "manifest" of characters, all of whom were presumed dead for years before their plane touched down in New York City. The show follows a brother and sister duo—Dallas and Roxburgh—as they seek to pick up the pieces and find out exactly what happened to them.</p><p><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/why-netflix-saved-manifest-1235013937/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Per&nbsp;Hollywood Reporter,</a>&nbsp;25 million Netflix accounts in the U.S. and Canada watched the show in its first month on Netflix.&nbsp;Even after&nbsp;Manifest&nbsp;dropped out of the No.1 spot, it continued to dominate Netflix's charts:&nbsp;In August of 2021, Nielson confirmed that&nbsp;Manifest&nbsp;had broken&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.thewrap.com/manifest-breaks-nielsens-streaming-ratings-record-with-6th-straight-week-over-1-billion-minutes-viewed/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>its streaming-ratings records</a>&nbsp;with more than a billion views a week for six straight weeks. And by September,&nbsp;Manifest&nbsp;was the third show in Netflix history to sit in its Top 10 for 100 days—ever.</p><p>Speaking to <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://deadline.com/2022/08/netflix-drama-series-jinny-howe-interview-virgin-river-partner-track-manifest-random-canyon-1235095999/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Deadline</a>, Netflix's Head of Drama Jinny Howe admitted, "It might be a show that you wouldn’t have normally expected from Netflix drama, but for us, it just feels like a best-in-class, hybrid, character driven-procedural show."</p><p>Here are the first posters for season 4:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kze9e2zZvg5avkmp9NQnDh-1920-80.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wzTeXasQ5jx35uNW72CsKB-1920-80.jpg><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-manifest-season-4-release-date><span>'Manifest' Season 4 Release Date</span></h2><p>The first ten episodes of Season 4 of Manifest were released on <strong>November 4, 2022</strong>.

Consumed by his grief, Ben has stepped down from his role as co-captain of the lifeboat, leaving Michaela to captain it alone, a near impossible feat with the passengers’ every move now being monitored by a government registry. As the Death Date draws closer and the passengers grow desperate for a path to survival, a mysterious passenger arrives with a package for Cal that changes everything they know about Flight 828 and will prove to be the key to unlocking the secret of the Callings in this compelling, mind-bending, and deeply emotional journey."</p><p>About that time jump: Rake revealed to <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/manifest-season-4-episode-1 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url=https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/100577549/type/dlg/sid/hawk-custom-tracking/https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/manifest-season-4-episode-1 data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name=netflix.com data-merchant-id=1070 data-merchant-url=netflix.com data-merchant-network=CJ>Tudum</a> that there will be flashbacks aplenty. "Two years is a lot of time to skip over in a serialized television show. And, of course, we don’t want the audience to miss out on anything, so we utilize a flashback storytelling device—not only in Episode 1, but in all 10.”</p><p>He also noted: "It’s going to become increasingly clear to the passengers that the callings are somehow divinely sourced and this is not just about them...his is either a gift or a burden—an opportunity to wake up the world and realize that it is all connected. And that we all need to be better if we want to keep living in this world.”</p><p>Josh Dallas, who plays Ben, shared some tidbits in an <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://netflixlife.com/2022/06/02/josh-dallas-teases-two-year-time-jump-manifest-season-4-interview/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>interview</a> with Netflix Life. "Sometimes I think—and of course, I haven’t gotten to the end—that [Ben] could be the agent of the apocalypse, the downfall of all of this because of the way he is so tenacious...The first part of the season is not going to be easy.” He also wrote about Ben on Twitter: "To be honest… he’s not in a great place," and&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://twitter.com/jeff_rake/status/1497023806451376137 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>tweeted</a>&nbsp;an on-set photo of a funeral, with the caption: "Brace yourselves."&nbsp;</p><p>When TV Line's Matt Webb Mitovich asked the cast who was most surprised by where their character ended up in the series finale, he reports, "J.R. Ramirez’s arm shot up fastest&nbsp;and&nbsp;highest." J.R. Ramirez plays plays Jared. "Long’s was not far behind." Long plays Zeke.</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-the-cast-of-manifest-season-4><span>The Cast of 'Manifest' Season 4</span></h2><p>The entire cast of Manifest were no longer contractually bound to the show after June 2021, according to&nbsp;Deadline's Nellie Andreeva.&nbsp;This led to some "ugly, ugly conversations that happened behind closed doors," Rake said in an <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://ew.com/tv/how-manifest-came-back-from-the-dead-season-4-netflix/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>interview with Entertainment Weekly.</a> "There were hard-fought negotiations and that's always tough. It's business. There were a lot of tough ones where people play chicken. Who's going to cave first? So, of course, that would come up: 'Do you absolutely need that person?' 'Could the story go on without that character?' 'Could you recast that role?' Truthfully, the answer was no."</p><p>Almost all of the cast signed on in September following the renewal—except for, of course, Athena Karkanis, who played Grace and whose character was murdered at the end of season 3, and Jack Messina, who played young Cal and was replaced by older Cal. (Though it's worth noting that Messina has popped up in behind-the-scenes <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://twitter.com/whatonnetflix/status/1488991816829579280?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1488991816829579280%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.whats-on-netflix.com%2Fnews%2Fmanifest-season-4-netflix-release-date-what-we-know-so-far-07-2022%2F" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>filming shots</a>.)

We'll meet Kyle Boyd, who was a passenger on Flight 828 alongside the key characters we know and love; Henry Kim, another Flight 828 passenger who was detailed in Singapore after the plane landed; and two more characters named Tela and June, whose backstories we know less about. We'll also meet a couple of smaller characters, reportedly named Captain Kevin Fahey and Detective Price. Season 4 will also reportedly feature a duo called "the Eden twins," according to a <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://twitter.com/RenewManifest/status/1518205250674569216?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1518205250674569216%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.whats-on-netflix.com%2Fnews%2Fmanifest-season-4-netflix-release-date-what-we-know-so-far-07-2022%2F" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>tweet</a> shared by the Renew Manifest account, though little is known about their roles.</p><p>And Ginnifer Goodwin—the Once Upon a Time star who's married to Josh Dallas in real life—might make an appearance, too.
