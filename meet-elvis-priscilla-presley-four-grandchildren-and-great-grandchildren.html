On naming her Tupelo after her great-grandfather elvis' birthplace, Riley admitted that they chose the name Tupelo before the Baz Luhrmann Elvis biopic revealed, and explained: "I was like, 'This is great because it's not really a well-known word or name in relation to my family' –– it's not like Memphis or something," before joking: "Then when the Elvis movie came out, it was like, Tupelo this and Tupelo that. I was like, 'Oh, no.' But it's fine."</p><p id=ew42zjVaeOuN data-wc=53>She also told the outlet of choosing to have a baby through surrogacy: "I think it's a very cool, selfless, and incredible act that these women do to help other people.
