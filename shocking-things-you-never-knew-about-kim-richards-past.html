Collett developed a serious crush on the beautiful actress after seeing her in Escape to Witch Mountain. The pair hit it off as soon as they met, and, according to many, were blissfully happy with each other. But in October of that year, Collett was gunned down outside a San Fernando deli by a hit man due to what many believe was a business deal gone wrong. Richards was the one who had to identify the body. Collett’s mother told People, “It just tore her apart emotionally and she was not in good shape for a long time. She really loved John. They were a good match.”</p><p><a tabindex=0 href=# class=lrv-u-flex@tablet><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/tilly.jpg alt="Jennifer Tilly" height width style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="c-span u-letter-spacing-015 lrv-u-text-transform-uppercase a-font-secondary-bold-s lrv-u-font-size-14 lrv-u-margin-t-050 lrv-u-margin-t-1@desktop lrv-u-margin-b-025 u-margin-tb-00@tablet lrv-u-display-block">Related story</span> <span class="c-title a-font-secondary-medium-s@mobile-max a-font-primary-xs@tablet lrv-u-line-height-normal lrv-u-color-black lrv-u-margin-b-1 u-margin-t-050@tablet lrv-u-padding-b-025 lrv-u-color-brand-primary:hover">Jennifer Tilly Just Made a Shocking Choice to Join This Reality Show & Fans Are Losing It</span></a></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>How the brutal murder of Kim Richards’ one true love broke her heart! <a href=# rel=nofollow>http://t.co/VtmEa5UAi9</a></p><p>— Radar Online (@radar_online) <a href=# rel=nofollow>April 28, 2015</a></p><p><br><strong>More:</strong> <a href=#>Kim Richards leaves rehab — but is she healthy?</a></p><h3>One of her children was placed on psychiatric hold</h3><p>Richards has four children with her two exes Monty Brinson and Gregg Davis: Kimberly, 21;&nbsp;Chad, 22;&nbsp;Whitney, 24; and Brooke, 29. In March of this year, one of her kids was <a href=# rel=nofollow>admitted to a psychiatric facility</a>. The child, who has remained unidentified, reportedly suffered from depression for a very long time. A source told Radar Online that the situation, unsurprisingly, was “very, very hard on Kim.”</p><p><strong>More:</strong> <a href=#>Kim Richards’ reaction to Dr. Phil accusation is so hard to watch (VIDEO)</a></p><h3>Her ex-boyfriend has a shady past</h3><p>Remember when <a href=# rel=nofollow>Richards was dating Ken Blumenfeld</a>? (That guy was the worst!) Everyone was wary of Blumenfeld — especially her sister Kyle — and it turns out for good reason: Blumenfeld was arrested for a DUI in 2009. Not exactly someone Kim ought to be hanging around with.</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://twitter.com/realmrhousewife/status/593541344901079040</a></p><h3>Her dog has a shady past</h3><p>Any fan of RHOBH knows how much Richards adores her pit bull, Kingsley. Kingsley, however, proves to be more bite than bark. Four people have now <a href=# rel=nofollow>accused Kingsley of biting them</a>, including Kim’s sister, Kyle, who claims the dog bit her daughter, Alexia; Kingsley’s trainer, David Utter; Kim’s 80-year-old friend Kay Rozario; and a woman named Kelly Crossley, who is suing Kim for unspecified damages.</p><h3>She was forced to marry someone rich</h3><p>According to the 2006 book House of Hilton, Kim Richards’ mother pressured her three daughters — Kim, Kyle, and Kathy Hilton — to <a href=# rel=nofollow>marry rich men</a>. In fact, supposedly when Kim’s ex, Monty Brinson, proposed, Kim gave him back the ring because she wanted a bigger one.</p><h3>She was forced to work from a very early age</h3><p>We all know that Kim was a child actress, but apparently, her very first TV appearance was when she was only a few months old. Kim’s mother had her crawling around on the floor for a rug commercial, and from then on, Kim’s supposed “stage mom” constantly pressured her to take up acting jobs.</p><h3>She cheated on her husband</h3><p><strong>More: </strong><a href=# id=auto-tag_real-housewives-of-beverly-hills_1 data-tag=real-housewives-of-beverly-hills>Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</a>‘ Kim Richards murder-for-hire plot</p><p>Recently, Kim has been caring for her ex-husband Monty Brinson, who’s been diagnosed with cancer, but when they were married, she allegedly cheated on him. Brinson claims, “Kim would say she had to go babysit [her nieces] Paris and Nicky and, really, she was being fixed up with John, and I found out about it. She was being influenced to do it. She was being pressured because of the billions of Davis dollars.” Kim actually wound up marrying the brother of the man she was being fixed up with — Gregg Davis — and Brinson thinks that it was her mother’s doing. He said, “[Kim’s mother] was looking for the best for her daughter and those guys [the Davis family] had mega-money.”</p><p>Yikes. Poor Kim. Doesn’t sound like she had the easiest, or most normal, upbringing. On the one hand, it helps explain some of her recent behavior and issues. But on the other, it just is really incredibly sad.</p><h3>Are you surprised to hear this?</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLTEpKWor6NjsLC5jp6lrZ2iqa6qusyepa1nkafBqq%2FLnqpoaWBtgnd9k2iqoaeToLavs4ytn6Kml6h6urvUZqWerpWneqy6xLBkmpqfqsFut8imZKuhk52us7DSZqeaq6Rk</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fshocking-things-you-never-knew-about-kim-richards-past.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fshocking-things-you-never-knew-about-kim-richards-past.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fshocking-things-you-never-knew-about-kim-richards-past.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fshocking-things-you-never-knew-about-kim-richards-past.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fshocking-things-you-never-knew-about-kim-richards-past.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fshocking-things-you-never-knew-about-kim-richards-past.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./adam-mckay-net-worth-2024.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./adam-mckay-net-worth-2024.html>Adam Mckay Net Worth 2024</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./best-floral-dresses.html>56 Mood-Boosting Floral Dresses to Shop</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./best-floral-dresses.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
