The light definitely did not win. &nbsp;</p><p>Sunday’s finale of the HBO anthology played largely true to the story it had told for the previous seven hours. Which meant that anyone looking for some hail-Mary ending by which everyone made it to Venezuela was left sorely disappointed.</p><p>A show deeply concerned with how its male characters project their masculinity ended with only women surviving. <span data-scayt_word=Ani data-scaytid=1>Ani</span> (<strong><a href=# id=auto-tag_rachel-mcadams data-tag=rachel-mcadams>Rachel McAdams</a></strong>) does in fact get to South America to meet up with Jordan (<strong>Kelly Reilly</strong>)&nbsp;<span>—</span>&nbsp;but neither of them is with the man she wanted to meet there.</p><p>Frank (<strong><a href=# id=auto-tag_vince-vaughn data-tag=vince-vaughn>Vince Vaughn</a></strong>), having executed his plan to take out <span data-scayt_word=Osip data-scaytid=2>Osip</span> (<strong>Timothy V. Murphy</strong>) and <span data-scayt_word=McCandless data-scaytid=3>McCandless</span> (<strong>Jon <span data-scayt_word=Lindstrom data-scaytid=4>Lindstrom</span></strong>), fails to realize the loose end he left with the Mexican drug dealers he bargained with earlier in the season and pays with his life in the desert.&nbsp;</p><p>Frank offers the $1 million in his suitcase for his freedom, but can’t abide giving up his suit — and the diamonds he’s carrying <span data-scayt_word=int data-scaytid=5>int</span> it — to one of the dealers. For that he gets stabbed in the gut and walks to his death past visions of his horrible father and other low points in his life, only to fall short of a dream of Jordan.</p><p>Ray (<strong><a href=# id=auto-tag_colin-farrell-0 data-tag=colin-farrell-0>Colin Farrell</a></strong>) dies too, but his demise comes off better. He makes the fatal mistake of wanting to see his son (who, it’s revealed in the closing montage, really is his son) one last time, which allows Burris (<strong>James <span data-scayt_word=Frain data-scaytid=6>Frain</span></strong>) to place a tracker on his car. After leading Burris and his goons on a chase into the forest, Ray goes down Wild Bunch-style in a barrage of bullets, while his final audio message to Chad fails to make it to its destination.</p><p>The two deaths capped off a somewhat oddly paced finale that spent its first third or so laying out the ins and outs of the <span data-scayt_word=Caspere data-scaytid=7>Caspere</span> murder case that kicked off the season.</p><p>As the Internet did between episode seven and the finale, Ray puts together that Lenny the movie-set photographer (<strong>Luke Edwards</strong>) was the second orphan from the 1992 diamond heist <span data-scayt_word=Caspere data-scaytid=8>Caspere</span>, Burris and Vinci PD Chief Holloway (<strong><span data-scayt_word=Afemo data-scaytid=12>Afemo</span> <span data-scayt_word=Omilami data-scaytid=13>Omilami</span></strong>) were involved in. And yes, Len and his sister Laura (<strong>Courtney <span data-scayt_word=Halverson data-scaytid=14>Halverson</span></strong>) killed <span data-scayt_word=Caspere data-scaytid=10>Caspere</span>, which in turn set off the investigation into Vinci, <span data-scayt_word="Caspere's" data-scaytid=16>Caspere’s</span> present-day corruption and the dirty rail corridor deal.</p><p>Len is planning to kill Holloway at an exchange of <span data-scayt_word="Caspere's" data-scaytid=17>Caspere’s</span> (blank, self-erasing) hard drive and the diamonds. Ray and <span data-scayt_word=Ani data-scaytid=19>Ani</span> try to dissuade him, and Ray takes his place at the meet. It almost works, until Holloway tells Ray that Laura is actually <span data-scayt_word="Caspere's" data-scaytid=18>Caspere’s</span> daughter. Len, sitting behind them, flies into a rage and stabs Holloway, and the resulting chaos ends with both of them shot dead, Burris winged and <span data-scayt_word=Ani data-scaytid=20>Ani</span> and Ray on the lam.</p><p>With the <span data-scayt_word=Caspere data-scaytid=25>Caspere</span> story (finally) closed, the remainder of the finale turns to the rot the murder uncovered. While Ray helps Frank take vengeance on the people who took his money and interest in the rail deal, <span data-scayt_word=Ani data-scaytid=26>Ani</span> goes to <span data-scayt_word="Pitlor's" data-scaytid=29>Pitlor’s</span> (<strong>Rick Springfield</strong>) compound in search of evidence about the orgies. She’s too late: <span data-scayt_word=Pitlor data-scaytid=30>Pitlor</span> is “suicided,” as she puts it, and his files cleaned out.</p><p>As Frank goes about tying up his business, he neglects to make the Mexicans whole for burning down the clubs. They <span data-scayt_word=carjack data-scaytid=31>carjack</span> him and lead him to the bleakest patch of desert you could possibly imagine, where the aforementioned suit leads to his downfall.</p><p>Frank’s slow walk to his death does provide a strong final showcase for Vaughn. Actor and character really seemed to mesh in the last few episodes; had there been more of that spark initially, Frank’s machinations might have played better.</p><p>With Ray and Frank dead, the show cuts to Venezuela a year-plus later. <span data-scayt_word=Ani data-scaytid=32>Ani</span> lays out the story for a reporter, and the audience sees that the larger corruption she and her cohorts fought against continues unchecked. Orgy organizer Tony <span data-scayt_word=Chessani data-scaytid=34>Chessani</span> (<strong><span data-scayt_word=Vinicius data-scaytid=35>Vinicius</span> Machado</strong>) is sworn in as mayor of Vinci with Burris at his side; <span data-scayt_word=now-Gov data-scaytid=36>now-Gov</span>. <span data-scayt_word=Geldof data-scaytid=37>Geldof</span> (<strong>C.S. Lee</strong>) drives a ceremonial spike on the rail line with Catalyst logos behind and above him.</p><p><span data-scayt_word=Ani data-scaytid=38>Ani</span> and Ray’s hookup also produced a baby, which she, Jordan and Frank’s loyal goon Nails (<strong>Chris <span data-scayt_word=Kerson data-scaytid=40>Kerson</span></strong>) are now raising (#<span data-scayt_word=TrueDetectiveSeason3 data-scaytid=41>TrueDetectiveSeason3</span>?). It’s meant to add some extra poignancy to Ray’s death, but it’s more of a “Really?” considering they were together just that one time.</p><p>There were more than a few moments like that during season two of True Detective, along with, to be fair, a number of good things as well (in particular, the performances of Farrell and McAdams and the wary way they approached Ray and <span data-scayt_word="Ani's" data-scaytid=42>Ani’s</span> relationship). They helped carry the show through moments when the mystery at its center was too murky to make much sense at all, but the overly convoluted case and the pulped-out <span data-scayt_word=dialogue data-scaytid=43>dialogue</span> too often held sway. If HBO and <strong><span data-scayt_word=Nic data-scaytid=44>Nic</span> <span data-scayt_word=Pizzolatto data-scaytid=45>Pizzolatto</span></strong> decide to do another season, throttling back on both measures would be a good idea.</p><p>What did you think of the True Detective finale, and season two as a whole?</p><p><strong>Aug. 10, 6:45 a.m.:</strong> The story has been updated to note, as several readers pointed out, that Frank was carrying diamonds in his suit during his standoff with the drug dealers, hence his unwillingness to part with it.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOramunV2ZsrWxwq2gr51dqLKiv86nZGtllp67orjEZm9qbGFqgHA%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftrue-detective-season-2-finale-814153.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftrue-detective-season-2-finale-814153.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftrue-detective-season-2-finale-814153.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftrue-detective-season-2-finale-814153.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftrue-detective-season-2-finale-814153.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftrue-detective-season-2-finale-814153.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./127435-deadpool-2-projected-to-be-highest-grossing-r-rated-film-on-fandango-news.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./127435-deadpool-2-projected-to-be-highest-grossing-r-rated-film-on-fandango-news.html>&amp;quot;Deadpool 2&amp;quot; Projected To Be Highest Grossing R-Rated Film On Fandango</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./what-does-phd-stand-for-sexually.html>What does PHD stand for sexually?
