Generally speaking, a 50/50 blend of G12 and distilled water is advised; but, in very cold locations, up to a 60/40 ratio of G12 and distilled water is permitted. A blue-green colour distinguishes the Volkswagen G11 coolant from a red colour distinguishing the Volkswagen G12.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>Also, do you know if g40 coolant is the same thing as g12?</h3><p>a3tdi2001 is a member of. Comma G40 is manufactured by BASF and is chemically identical to G12++. If your old gear is pink (G30, which is the same as G12/G12+), it’s a good idea to flush the system before switching over, even if they’re all supposedly interchangeable. As recommended by Comma, distilled water should be used when diluting a solution with distilled water.</p><p></p><h3>Is it necessary for me to use G12 coolant in this situation?</h3><p>You are not permitted to combine G12 with any other kind of coolant, including water. (RVs021) If you completely remove all traces of g12 from your cooling system, you may use whatever kind of coolant you wish. A disgusting brown sludge is created in the system when the two are combined in the wrong way.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>Is it possible to use g13 coolant in place of g12 coolant?</h3><p>This product has the same great cooling and antifreeze properties as the G12++, but it is made from glycerin instead of silicone. Glycerin, as opposed to glycol, is far less hazardous to the environment. The G13 is also an excellent cooling and corrosion-protection material, since it resists corrosion and chalk deposits.</p><p></p><h3>There were 36 related questions and answers found.</h3><p></p><h3>What kind of coolant does Volkswagen employ?</h3><p>Volkswagen utilises an antifreeze that has been certified by Audi and Volkswagen G13 or G1The kind of expansion tank that your specific model makes use of should be marked on the tank and stated in the owner’s handbook for easy identification. Volkswagen coolant is usually a pink or purple hue, depending on the model. If you’re topping up your car, be sure to use the same colour as your vehicle currently has.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-149 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>Is it necessary to dilute the g12 coolant?</h3><p>Check to see if you have the correct anti-phosphate anti-amine G11 or G12 VW coolant in your vehicle’s reservoir. Fill the cooling system of your Volkswagen with this 50/50 mixture. It is necessary to dilute the coolant with DISTILLED water to a 50/50 concentration before using it. It is not recommended to combine regular tap water with coolant.</p><p></p><h3>Prestone is a g12, correct?</h3><p>G12/G13 coolants are recommended by several manufacturers, including Volkswagen and Audi, for use in their systems. And this is only due to the fact that G12 has superior lubricating capabilities (which is why it is sometimes called “lifelong coolant”). The regular coolant, on the other hand (let’s use Prestone as an example), does not contain any phosphates.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-150 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>Is it possible to mix water into G12 coolant?</h3><p>Generally speaking, a 50/50 blend of G12 and distilled water is advised; but, in very cold locations, up to a 60/40 ratio of G12 and distilled water is permitted. When using G11 or G12, do not exceed a coolant mixture of higher than 60%! G11 and G12 should not be mixed, nor should they be mixed with any other coolant. It is not permitted to combine different types of coolant.</p><p></p><h3>Is it possible to combine two different coolants?</h3><p>The green and orange coolants are incompatible with one another. When they are combined, they produce a gel-like material that prevents coolant flow and, as a result, causes the engine to overheat. There are some coolants that claim to be compatible with Dexcool, but I would rather err on the side of caution and only add what the system is supposed to take rather than take a chance on it.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-151 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>Is it possible to simply add water to my coolant?</h3><p>In this case, water may be used in place of coolant in the radiator, however it is recommended to use a blend of coolant and water since simple water will boil before the right coolant will boil, causing your engine to overheat [source: pontiac]. If there isn’t enough coolant in the system, the automobile radiator will not function properly.</p><p></p><h3>Is it okay to use Prestone coolant in my Volkswagen?</h3><p>NEW Specifically developed for use in Volkswagen®, Audi®, Mercedes®, BMW®/MINI®, and Volvo® automobiles**, Prestone 50/50 Prediluted Antifreeze/Coolant for European vehicles is a prediluted antifreeze/coolant that is 50/50 prediluted. Prestone, the #1 Branded Engine Protection*, prevents rust from spreading throughout an engine’s cooling system, allowing it to operate more effectively and last longer.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-152 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>Is g12 coolant the same as Dexcool in terms of performance?</h3><p>Theoretically, G12 and G13 may be mixed without causing problems. When using G12 in conjunction with Dexcool (orange) or generic ethylene glycol (green or yellow), it is possible that the mixture may congeal and clog the heater core, radiator, pipes, and water pump.</p><p></p><h3>Is it possible to combine pink and purple coolant?</h3><p>Both the purple and above-pink Volkswagen coolants are interchangeable and may be blended together. And another (similar claims are made FOUR times- once in each of the descriptions for red/pink and purple coolant, and once in each of the descriptions for blue/green coolant). This pink Vw coolant and the purple Vw coolant below it are interchangeable and may be blended together.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-153 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>What is the best way to tell whether my coolant is G12?</h3><p>G12 is represented by the colour PINK. You are absolutely accurate. A other kind of coolant (other than G12) should be cleaned out thoroughly and the system re-filled with G12 before continuing. Using G12 in conjunction with a different coolant might cause serious problems.</p><p></p><h3>What antifreeze should I use and how do I know what to use?</h3><p>Rather of removing the radiator cap, just check to see whether the liquid level has reached the “Full” line on the side of the coolant reservoir, as shown in this illustration. It’s an element of the system that recovers coolant. If the liquid does not reach the “Full” line after a few minutes, open the bottle and add a 50/50 mixture of water and coolant to bring it up to that level.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>Is it possible to use ordinary coolant in my Audi?</h3><p>ONLY Audi VW G13 or G12 approved coolant should be used! Avoid using regular store-bought coolant because it is not designed to meet the specifications of an Audi cooling system and may cause damage to the vehicle. The majority of Audi coolant is available in concentrated form. It is necessary to dilute the coolant with DISTILLED water to a 50/50 concentration before using it.</p><p></p><h3>What type of coolant does my vehicle utilise?</h3><p>Organic Acid Technology (OAT) and Hybrid Organic Acid Technology (HOAT) are the three primary kinds of coolant that automobile manufacturers employ: Inorganic Additive Technologies, Organic Acid Technologies, and Hybrid Organic Acid Technologies (HOAT). IAT is typically found in older automobiles. It must be replaced every two years or 24,000 miles, making it much less efficient than current formulae.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155 data-inserter-version=2></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r6%2FEq6upp5mjwW%2BvzqZma2hiZnxyfo6wn5qsXZiur3nIZqysnV2eu7TAxJqbZqeWYrRyfoycpqikkaPBb7TTpqM%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-can-i-use-instead-of-g12-coolant-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-can-i-use-instead-of-g12-coolant-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-can-i-use-instead-of-g12-coolant-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-can-i-use-instead-of-g12-coolant-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-can-i-use-instead-of-g12-coolant-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-can-i-use-instead-of-g12-coolant-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./who-is-joshua-waitzkin-dating-now-relationship-history-and-current-status-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./who-is-joshua-waitzkin-dating-now-relationship-history-and-current-status-html.html>Who is Joshua Waitzkin Dating Now? | Relationship History and Current Status</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./500843-wale-performs-the-girls-do-drugs-on-jimmy-fallon-new-video.html>Wale Performs &amp;quot;The Girls On Drugs&amp;quot; On Jimmy Fallon</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./500843-wale-performs-the-girls-do-drugs-on-jimmy-fallon-new-video.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
