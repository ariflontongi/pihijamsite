Some of them quietly go about their business, while others become social media sensations. One such sensation is Dog Daddy, whose real name is Augusto Deoliveira. He’s gained immense popularity for his dog training methods, but not all of it has been positive.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><strong>Dog Daddy’s Rise to Fame</strong></h3><p>Dog Daddy, also known as Augusto Deoliveira, is a dog trainer who has made a name for himself by sharing his training techniques online. Platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube have seen a surge of self-proclaimed dog trainers in recent times, and Dog Daddy is one of them.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><strong>The Controversy Surrounding Dog Daddy</strong></h3><p>However, fame often comes with scrutiny, and Dog Daddy found himself in the eye of a storm. Several videos surfaced on the internet that raised concerns among viewers. In these videos, Dog Daddy can be seen using what some consider harsh leash training methods on dogs. Many people on the internet found this approach unacceptable and even distressing.</p><h3><strong>What Did Dog Daddy Do Wrong?</strong></h3><p>The videos that garnered the most attention showed Dog Daddy seemingly using forceful tactics, including pulling a dog by its neck. This raised alarm bells for animal lovers and advocates who were worried about the dog’s well-being. Critics argued that such methods were inhumane and unnecessary.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><strong>Why the Backlash Against Dog Daddy?</strong></h3><p>The intense backlash against Dog Daddy stemmed from the aggressive nature of his training style. In one video, a dog appeared to collapse due to exhaustion and a lack of oxygen as Augusto Deoliveira took control of the leash. The dog struggled, occasionally attempting to bite him. To many, it seemed like the dog was being subjected to torture.</p><h3><strong>Accusations Against Dog Daddy</strong></h3><p>The accusations against Dog Daddy didn’t stop at his training methods. Some claimed that he failed to deliver on training promises made to dog owners. Additionally, there were allegations of him selling dogs with fraudulent health and temperament information. This led to legal consequences, with bans on his dog training businesses in countries like Italy and Sweden.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-149 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><strong>Dog Daddy’s Response to the Controversy</strong></h3><p>Amid the growing controversy and criticism, Dog Daddy took to social media to address the concerns. He posted an apology video where he acknowledged some of his actions had upset dog owners and animal advocates. He admitted that some of his training methods had been perceived as animal “abuse.” In response, he announced a break from his training activities to reflect on his methods. However, he made a comeback shortly after.</p><h3><strong>Who Is Dog Daddy, and Is He Cruel to Dogs?</strong></h3><p>Augusto Deoliveira, also known as Dog Daddy, boasts millions of followers on social media. He gained fame after a video of him confidently walking five German shepherds off-leash in New York went viral. According to his website, he offers various classes that combine seminars and hands-on training for clients.</p><p>For those interested in his services, Dog Daddy charges a substantial fee. A three-hour group class costs $400, a 90-minute session is priced at $1,200, and those who wish to observe a group class of him training dogs can do so for $100.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-150 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3><p>While Dog Daddy may have risen to fame for his confident dog training techniques, the controversy surrounding his methods cannot be ignored. The allegations of harsh training tactics and fraudulent practices have cast a shadow over his reputation. It remains to be seen whether he will modify his training methods and regain the trust of dog owners and animal lovers worldwide.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-151 data-inserter-version=2></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r6%2FEq6upp5mjwW%2BvzqZma2hiaHxxhY6wn6hlmah6pbvGZpuanJSueri0wK1knaGUYq62s9Ssq6hllJq8rbXVnqCrmV2ZvG%2B006aj</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-dog-daddy-what-did-augusto-deoliveira-do-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-is-dog-daddy-what-did-augusto-deoliveira-do-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-dog-daddy-what-did-augusto-deoliveira-do-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-is-dog-daddy-what-did-augusto-deoliveira-do-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-dog-daddy-what-did-augusto-deoliveira-do-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-dog-daddy-what-did-augusto-deoliveira-do-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./will-a-taser-stop-a-bear.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./will-a-taser-stop-a-bear.html>Will a Taser stop a bear?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./what-happened-to-sabatiellos-html.html>What happened to Sabatiellos?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./what-happened-to-sabatiellos-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
