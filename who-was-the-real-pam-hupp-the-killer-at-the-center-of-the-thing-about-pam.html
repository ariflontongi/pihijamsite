Last year, she was charged with another brutal killing—her friend Elizabeth “Betsy” Faria, for which Hupp is currently awaiting trial.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The story of Pam Hupp and the crimes in which she’s entangled have captivated true crime buffs for years, first as episodes of NBC’s Dateline in 2014 (among their most successful ever, next to their coverage of OJ Simpson and the murder of JonBenet Ramsey) and then as a hit podcast which debuted in 2019.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Now, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/features/a39435210/0001-0105-renee-zellweger-lets-down-her-guard-sort-of-april-2022/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Renée Zellweger" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Renée Zellweger</a> takes on the role of Hupp in the scripted drama series The Thing About Pam.

But on Tuesday, December 27, 2011, upon returning to his home in Troy, Missouri, Faria made a grisly discovery. His wife, Betsy, was dead. She had been stabbed more than 50 times and the knife still protruded from her neck.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Calling 911, Russ told the dispatchers that his wife may have killed herself. She had been diagnosed with terminal breast cancer earlier that year and had a history of threatening suicide. But investigators didn’t buy his story. Betsy’s death was far too brutal, and Russ was going in and out of hysteria during the 911 call, which led investigators to believe "<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Pages/casedetail.aspx?caseid=4792" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="his demeanor was staged" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">his demeanor was staged</a>."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The following morning, Russ was arrested and charged with Betsy’s murder. At trial, Russ was represented by attorney Joel Schwartz, who told the jury that his client had four solid alibis, offering proof of Russ’s whereabouts with cellphone data that showed he was more than 20 miles from the crime scene around the time of the murder had occurred.</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="body-h2 css-1ooignj emevuu60">How Pam fits in</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">According to court documents obtained by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nbcnews.com/dateline/pam-hupp-charged-first-degree-murder-2011-stabbing-death-betsy-n1273772 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Dateline in July last year" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Dateline in July last year</a>, the last person to see Betsy alive was her friend Pam.

She claimed Russ was an aggressive drinker who verbally abused Betsy. Despite convincing evidence of his innocence—four alibis, the cellphone data, and a lack of blood on his clothes— the prosecutor accused the alibi witnesses of plotting “the ultimate role play,” per a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://fox2now.com/news/pam-hupp/heres-how-faria-prosecutors-got-their-wrongful-conviction/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="FOX 2 local news report" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">FOX 2 local news report</a>. The jury convicted Russ of murder, but that verdict was overturned and a new trial was ordered.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In Russ's retrial two years later, Pam was asked why she became the sole beneficiary of Betsy’s $150,000 life insurance policy. She tried to explain that $100,000 would be set up in a trust for Betsy’s daughters. The other $50,000? “My other girlfriend died of breast cancer in August,” Pam said at the trial, according to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.stlmag.com/longform/pam-hupp/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="St. Louis" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">St. Louis</a> magazine, “and she has a 12-year-old daughter that I’m trying to help.” As it turns out, the daughter’s friend never received any help.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Russ spent three years in prison before he was acquitted in the 2015 retrial. He later brought a civil suit against three police offers alleging they had "fabricated evidence" and "failed to investigate the other obvious suspect,” and was awarded $2 million in compensation in an out-of-court settlement, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/crime/russ-faria-framed-for-murdering-his-wife-on-accused-killer-pam-hupp/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=People class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">People</a> reported.<br></p><img alt="the thing about pam shes a loving daughter episode 104 pictured l r lara grice as cousin mary, glenn fleshler as russ faria, susan shalhoub larkin as luci photo by skip bolennbc" title="the thing about pam shes a loving daughter episode 104 pictured l r lara grice as cousin mary, glenn fleshler as russ faria, susan shalhoub larkin as luci photo by skip bolennbc" width=1000 height=667 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/nup-195553-05339-jpg-1649264805.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Skip Bolen/NBC</span></p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="body-h2 css-1ooignj emevuu60">Louis Gumpenberger is fatally shot</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In August 2016, Pam fatally shot Louis Gumpenberger, a 33-year-old with mental and physical disabilities.

In a meta true crime twist, Pam had allegedly lured him into her home by posing as a Dateline producer needing help with a story.
